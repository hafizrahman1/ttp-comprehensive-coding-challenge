**Question A -- countWays(n):** A child is climbing up a staircase with n steps, and can hop either 1 step, 2 steps, or 3 steps at a time. Implement a method to count how many possible ways the child can jump up the stairs.

**Question B -- sortByStrings(s,t):** Sort the letters in the string s by the order they occur in the string t. You can assume t will not have repetitive characters. For s = "weather" and t = "therapyw", the output should be sortByString(s, t) = "theeraw". For s = "good" and t = "odg", the output should be sortByString(s, t) = "oodg".

**Question C -- Web Crawler:** I wrote a crawler that visits web pages, stores a few keywords in a database, and follows links to other web pages. I noticed that my crawler was wasting a lot of time visiting the same pages over and over, so I made a set, visited, where I'm storing URLs I've already visited. Now the crawler only visits a URL if it hasn't already been visited. Letâ€™s see if we can make this crawler use less memory. See if you can come up with a data structure better than a hash that just stores the entire URL. How can we trim down the amount of space taken up by visited? Explain in words and implement your solution.
